# ASL X-Plane 11 Test Platform

Based on the popular X-Plane 11 a photo-realistic aircraft simulator with accurate physics. 

We present a Python-based simulation platform to test and benchmark the
performance of perception and control algorithms on challenging control,
learning-based control and out-of-distribution control real-world problems in
flight.

This code build on the plugin 
[NASA-ULI-Xplane repo](https://github.com/StanfordASL/NASA_ULI_Xplane_Simulator/tree/main). X-Plane 11 is . 

In our own work, we use it to test on 
  - vision-based autonomous taxiing
  - autonomous landing
